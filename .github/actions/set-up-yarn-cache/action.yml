  Sets up caching for yarn install steps.
  Caches yarn's cache directory, install state, and node_modules.

    # We try to cache and restore yarn's cache directory and install state to speed up the yarn install step.
    # Caching yarn's cache directory avoids its fetch step.

    # If the primary key doesn't match, the cache will probably be stale or incomplete,
    # but still worth restoring for the yarn install step.
