- Add Storybook (Vite) framework package (#10064) by @arimendelow

Adds:

- Storybook framework package for using Storybook with Vite.
- CLI package (command: `yarn rw sbv`) for running Storybook using Vite. CLI package additionally creates Mock Service Worker, and, on first run, the project-side Storybook config files.

Current Storybook (Webpack) users will need to manually migrate any additional Storybook config (mocks, etc.). The primary user-facing difference between the old and new Storybook integrations is that the config used by the old one lives in the `@redwoodjs/testing` package, and the config used by this new one lives in the user's `web/.storybook` directory.
