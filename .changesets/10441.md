- feat(og-gen): Update implementation of useLocation | Update App template (#10441) by @dac09
  **Updated App.tsx template**
  We modified the `App.tsx` template to accept possible children, and render them if present. This lets the og:image handler inject your component into the Document tree, without including the entire Router, but still style your og:image component using whatever you used to style the rest of your app (Tailwind, perhaps?)

**Updated useLocation implementation**
We also modified the `useLocation()` hook to now return everything that the [URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) returns. Previously it only returned three attributes of the url (pathname, search, hash), now it returns everything available to a call to `new URL()` (origin, href, searchParams, etc.).

The reason for this is now that we have SSR, we can get access to more details in the hook - in this case we needed origin

Both changes should be non-breaking!
