- feat: add customize content type parsers for api plugin (#10573) by @Josh-Walker-GM

This change adds a new `configureApiServer` option to the `createServer` function used within the server file. This fixes an issue where it was not possible to configure the API server - such as adding custom content parsers or adding compression. Updated docs on how to use this new functionality can currently be found [here](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/canary/docker#using-the-server-file).
