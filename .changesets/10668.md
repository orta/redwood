- fix(dbAuthMw): Update and fix logic related to dbAuth "verbs" and decryptionErrors (#10668) by @dac09

This PR does the following:

- updates the dbauth mw to correctly handle the cookieName option (it should always have been optional)
- throws an error when the `dbAuthSession` returns an empty decoded token so that it clears the authState
- we had a check for only "POST" requests to be passed to the dbAuthHandler. This was incorrect because some of the dbAuth "verbs" or actions - like `webAuthnRegOptions` - uses a GET request.

As a result, the tests started showing failures, so I:

- added a mock for `dbAuthSession`, so we can check both happy path and unhappy paths for session decryption
- updated the tests where relevant
