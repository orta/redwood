- fix: Update default tsconfig options (target, module and moduleResolution) (#11170) by @Josh-Walker-GM

This changes the default values of:

- target
- module
- moduleResolution

in the tsconfig files for both the API and web side. The benefit of this change is increased correctness for build time checking of the imports from packages which specify `exports` in their `package.json` files.

This change will have a limited effect while Redwood apps are still built to CJS rather than ESM. After that switch to ESM there would be more breaking changes but they are not applied here and are a future concern.
