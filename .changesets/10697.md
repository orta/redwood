- feat(serverStore): Add location to serverStore for RSCs to access location (#10697) by @dac09

1. Adds fullUrl property to serverStore
2. Adds two utility functions:
   a) `getFullUrl` - to construct the absolute url from an express request
   b) `getFullUrlFromFlightRequest` - this is used when we get a request to render RSCs in the rscRequestHandler. This one is different because the location we want is for the actual page, not of the request (which goes to to the RSC endpoint).
3. Adds `getLocation` function to retrieve the Location (URL object) from server store

Short video demonstrating location coming through in two cases:
a) Soft renders (makes a request to the RSC endpoint)
b) Hard render

**Usage example:**

```tsx
import { getLocation } from '@redwoodjs/vite/serverStore'

const NavigationLayout = ({ children, rnd }: NavigationLayoutProps) => {
  const location = getLocation()
  console.log(`ðŸ‘‰ \n ~ location:`, location)
```

Longer term, we may want to change how the endpoint for flight requests so that the location doesn't have to be constructed specially.
