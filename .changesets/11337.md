- refactor(prerender): build with esbuild and introduce conditional exports (#11337) by @Josh-Walker-GM

This change restricts the available imports from the `@redwoodjs/prerender` package. You will also have to use modern `moduleResolution` settings in your tsconfig to resolve the imports correctly within TS.
