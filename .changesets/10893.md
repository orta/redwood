fix(realtime/trusted-docs): Supports GraphQL subscriptions and trusted documents (#10893) by @dthyresson

Fixes: https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/issues/10892

This PR updates the SSELink to check if there is a trusted document hash in the request. If there is, then don't also include the query.

The persisted operations plugin checks if the params has a query. If it does then raises an error that only persisted operations are allowed.

Subscriptions failed this test because the request had both the hash and a query. And since there were query details, the request was blocked.

Now, if there is a hash, the SSELink won't add back the query and thus it succeeds.
