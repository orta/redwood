- fix(cli-cache): Remove RW CLI cache on upgrade (#11135) by @dac09

This change removes the redwood cli plugin cache in `.redwood/commandCache.json` on running `rw upgrade`.

This prevents the redwood CLI from using outdated versions of CLI plugins, and is particularly important when they same alias.

**Before**
running `yarn rw sb` -> would use the outdated storybook-cli package, and error out.

**After**
with no commandCache, it'll create a new command cache, and attempt to install the new vite CLI
