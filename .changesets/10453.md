- feat: Remove `--performance` option from `yarn rw build` (#10453) by @Josh-Walker-GM

This change removes the `--performance` flag from the `yarn rw build` command. It will no longer be available to use and the CLI will no longer accept this flag being passed in.

Additionally, the associated webpack config (`@redwoodjs/core/config/webpack.perf.js`) has been removed so it can no longer be imported if you were doing so.
