feat(prisma): Support multi file Prisma schemas (#10869) by @dthyresson

Prisma's `prismaSchemaFolder` [feature](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview/location#multi-file-prisma-schema) allows you to define multiple files in a schema subdirectory of your prisma directory.

This PR updates:

- Prisma utilities
- generators
- dbAuth setup
- documentation

to support single and multi file Prisma schemas.

If you have enabled Prisma multi file schemas, you configure your project toml api `schemaPath` setting the directory where your schema.prisma can be found, for example: './api/db/schema'

When [organizing your Prisma Schema into multiple files](https://www.prisma.io/blog/organize-your-prisma-schema-with-multi-file-support), you will need [enable](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview/location#multi-file-prisma-schema) that feature in Prisma, move your `schema.prisma` file into a new directory such as `./api/db/schema` and then set `schemaPath` in the api toml config.

For example:

```toml title="redwood.toml"
[api]
  port = 8911
  schemaPath = "./api/db/schema"
```
