- fix(cli): Service generator supports relations (#11250) by @dthyresson

This PR address an issue when using `yarn rw g service` independently vs having ti be called by `yarn rw g sdl` or `yarn rw g scaffold`.

When using `yarn rw g service`, the model's relations were not correctly determined. For the sdl generator, relations are determined and then passed as an argument to the service generator; however, if you run just the service generator, the relations were always `[]`.

This PR fixes that by adding a check to see if the relations are already passed in as an argument. If they are, it uses that; otherwise, it falls back to determining the relations itself.
