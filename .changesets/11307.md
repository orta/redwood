- refactor(api): Add conditional exports to package.json (#11307) by @Josh-Walker-GM

This change restricts the available imports from this package. You can no longer freely import from within the dist like `@redwoodjs/api/dist/...`. If you were doing so please consult the `@redwoodjs/api` `package.json` file to see what exports are now available.
