- SSR: Better ServerEntry types (#10412) by @Tobbe

When enabling SSR the setup command will generate an `entry.server.tsx` file in the user's app. This file exports a `ServerEntry` component that takes `css` and ` meta` as props. The `meta` props used to be typed as `any`, making it difficult to use with confidence. This PR makes the type be `TagDescriptor[]` which is more correct.
