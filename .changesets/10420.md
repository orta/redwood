- feat: [Auth] Common AuthProvider & use\* changes for middleware auth #10420 by @dac09 and @dthyresson

* First step of supporting Auth using middleware
* Ensure backwards compatibility with non-SSR auth

### Breaking Change

Removes `skipFetchCurrentUser` which was used by the no longer existing nHost auth provider, but could potentially have been used by custom auth.
