- feat(uploads): Configure apollo client to do multi-part form uploads (#11175) by @dac09

a) Configures the Apollo client we export to use upload link - https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client
b) Configures our API side fastify server to accept multipart form data

Notes:

1.  apollo-upload-client is ESM only. In order to get this working for prerender, I had to bundle it for CJS version only.
    Without this change you get errors during prerender like this:

```
Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /Users/dac09/Experiments/apollo-upload-link/node_modules/apollo-upload-client/createUploadLink.mjs not supported.
```

2. Currently the multi-part config only applies when you have a server file (see separate PR with fix: https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/pull/11176)

3. The upload link internally will handle whether to do a regular POST or multipart POST. In order to make use of this on the backend you need to set your graphql schema field to a scalar of `File`
