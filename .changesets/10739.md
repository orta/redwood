- Updates seeds script to be more generic, no more errors throw on first run (#10739) by @cannikin

Updated the template seed script to not contain any actual seed data, just comments about how to use it when the time comes. The first time you migrate the console message will point you to the file, and the file will point you to a new docs page which goes into much more detail on usage.
