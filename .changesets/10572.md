- feat: feat: Reworks RSC server entries and route manifest building to derive from routes and include if route info related to authentication (#10572) by @dthyresson

This PR is in furtherance of authentication support in RSC.

It refactors:

- How server entries are built -- not from "processing the pages dir" (which is a deprecated function) but rather the routes ... and the page info for that route. Note here that a page can be used in multiple routes, so the auth info cannot really be determined here.

- The route manifest building to include per route:

* isPrivate - is the route private, i.e, is it wrapped in a PrivateSet
* unauthenticated - what route to navigate to if the user in not authenticated
* roles - the roles to check to see if user has the require RBAC permission to navigate to the route

Now if some page, route request is being handled by RSC we might be able to check if it "isPrivate" and enforce auth with the roles and even where tp redirect to if not authenticated.
