- feat(server-auth): Refactor useReauthenticate to prevent double currentUser calls (#10531) by @dac09

â€¦by calling getCurrentUser to determine if youre logged in.

We achieve this by swapping the order in which getUserMetadata and getCurrentUser is called in reauthenticate.

Previously getUserMetadata was a short-hand for checking if the auth SDK think its logged in, however in middleware auth this is an issue because you _need_ to getCurrentUser before getting user metadata in the case of purely cookie based auth like dbAuth (and potentially future ones like firebase, etc.) - since the cookie/token cannot be read on the browser.
