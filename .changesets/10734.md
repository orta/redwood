- chore(auth): add password validation to dbAuth resetPassword handler (#10734) by @irg1008

Related to #10724. This pull request adds password validation on resetPassword handler using the one from the signup handler.

This could affect some users that "expect" no validation from this handler and some new errors and failed tests may be raised for them, but I think this feature is primary concerning security and to mantain validation logic between handlers
