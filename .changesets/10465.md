- feat(server-auth): Update getAuthenticationContext to support cookies and tokens both (#10465) by @dac09

**1. Updates `getAuthenticationContext` to parse the cookie header and pass it to authDecoder.**

Note that the authentication context itself does not pull out the token from cookies, because with some providers (e.g. supabase) - we don't know the name of the cookie. This is left to the authDecoder implementation.

The return type from this function is actually just a deserialized cookie header i.e.
`cookie: auth-provider=one; session=xx/yy/zz; somethingElse=bsbs` => `{ 'auth-provider': 'one',  session: 'xx/yy/zz', somethingElse: 'bsbs'`

**2. Retains support for header/token based auth**
See test on line 259 of `packages/api/src/auth/__tests__/getAuthenticationContext.test.ts`. If a the `authorization` and `auth-provider` headers are passed in the request (as we do for SPA based auth) - then cookies will take precedence.

The end result is that graphql requests will now work with middleware-based auth providers!
