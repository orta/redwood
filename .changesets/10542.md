- Rename og component assets from _.png.jsx to just_.og.jsx (#10542) by @cannikin

We ran into a conflict where you could name your component file something like `AboutPage.png.jsx` (where the returned content-type would be image/png). But, when you invoke `useOgImage()` to actually create the URL for a `<meta>` tag, you could instead use a different extension, like `.jpg`. Which one should win?

After discussion with @dac09 and @mojombo we decided that the extension returned by `useOgImage()` would be the correct one, and that the filename of the component itself should become generic and not imply any specific file format.
