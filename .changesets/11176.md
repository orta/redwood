- fix(api-server): Use createServer in all cases, to make fastify config consistent (#11176) by @dac09

[BREAKING] Removes serverConfig support, in favour of server file to configure your Fastify instance.
You can still customise your server settings by running `yarn rw setup server-file` first. See docs for [Server File](https://docs.redwoodjs.com/docs/docker/#using-the-server-file)

This PR removes all the cases where we use `createFastifyInstance` for the api server, and replaces it with `createServer`. This makes sure that the API server config is always consistent - whether you use a server file or not.
