- docs(docker): Clarify how to setup Docker with custom Server File (#10702) by @dthyresson

Clarify how to setup Docker with custom Server File.

While the Docker documentation does instruct how to user Docker with the custom server file, the instructions could be easily missed.

In the follow support issue https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/unknown-directive-live-in-docker/7150/7 redwoodJS was setup to use Docker and also GraphQL with Realtime.

Realtime (and live queries) worked with rw dev, api set and also Docker dev -- but not production Docker.

In production Docker, the server file was never run and therefore the plugin to setup GraphQL with the useRedwoodRealtime plugin never happened ... and thus the live directive wasn't understood nor were GraphQL subscripts added to the schema.

Here api server, simply ran the GraphQL function as expected, but the plugin was never invoked so Realtime was never configured or added to the schema.

This happened because by default, production Docker launch the plain vanilla api server -- it didn't launch server file that uses `createServer` to setup a separate GraphQL server and also add in the realtime plugin.
