- chore(serverAuth): Rename serverAuthContext to serverAuthState where relevant (#10643) by @dac09

**Why?**
As we make auth available on RSC, we want to avoid the use of the word "context"

1. Because context is over used
2. It's confusing because RSCs don't support React.context

This PR renames `serverAuthContext` -> `serverAuthState`. The only case it doesn't change it is the _actual_ ServerAuthContext which is a React context we use for SSR/Streaming
