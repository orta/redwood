docs(directives): Removes outdated mockAsyncRedwoodDirective and explains how to test async directives (#10827) by @dthyresson

Fixes #10812

This PR removes mockAsyncRedwoodDirective from documentation and properly show how to test async directives using resolves and rejects.

History:

mockAsyncRedwoodDirective was an early implementation but after PR review it was determined that a separate functions wasn't needed, but the resolves/rejects could be uses by making mockRedwoodDirective handle promises better. However, the documentation retained the older reference.
