- Adds background job scheduling and execution (#10906) by @cannikin

This new package provides scheduling and processing of background jobs. We want everything needed to run a modern web application to be included in Redwood itself—you shouldn't need any third party integrations if you don't want.

Background jobs have been sorely missed, but the time has come! (If you do want to use a third party service we have had an [integration with Inngest](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/ship-background-jobs-crons-webhooks-and-reliable-workflows-in-record-time-with-inngest-and-redwoodjs/4866) since May of 2023!)

## Features

- Named queues: you can schedule jobs in separate named queues and have a different number of workers monitoring each one—makes it much easier to scale your background processing
- Priority: give your jobs a priority from 1 (highest) to 100 (lowest). Workers will sort available jobs by priority, working the most important ones first.
- Configurable delay: run your job as soon as possible (default), wait a number of seconds before running, or run at a specific time in the future
- Auto-retries with backoff: if your job fails it will back off at the rate of attempts \*\* 4 for a default of 24 tries, the time between the last two attempts is a little over three days.
- Run inline: instead of scheduling to run in the background, run immediately
- Integrates with Redwood's [logger](https://docs.redwoodjs.com/docs/logger): use your existing one in api/src/lib/logger or create a new one just for job logging
