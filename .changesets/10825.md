- fix: Fixes support for Mocking GraphQL Queries in Storybook whene using GraphQL Fragments(#108125) by @dthyresson

Fixes https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/issues/10807

If one used GraphQL fragments, when mocking the GraphQL query for use in Storybook, the `typename` for the data object must be included otherwise Apollo client cannot properly map the data.

This PR

- adds the typename to the cell generator templates
- updates the testing and graphql mock and fragments documentation to show how properly defines mock data
