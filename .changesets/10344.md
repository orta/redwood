- feat(tw): Add IntelliSense settings for Tailwind CSS VS Code plugin (#10344) by @Tobbe

Add intellisense and color support for not only `className` (which is enabled by default), but also for `activeClassName` and `errorClassName`, which are two css class name props we use in Redwood

## Manual Instructions

If you already have TW set up and want to enable this, open `.vscode/settings.json` and add this:

```json
"tailwindCSS": {
  "classAttributes": ["class", "className", "activeClassName", "errorClassName"]
}
```
