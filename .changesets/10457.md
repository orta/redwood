- feat(server-auth): dbAuth 3/3 - handle login, logout, signup, etc. requests if forwarded from middleware (#10457) by @dac09

This PR updates the DbAuthHandler class to handle requests forwarded from middleware, so it can generate responses for login, logout, signup, etc. These are POST requests - it used to be to the `/auth` function, but now they will be captured by dbAuth middleware and forwarded onto DbAuthHandler.

**High level changes:**

- use the `Headers` class in each of the "method" responses. This allows us to set multi-value headers like Set-Cookie. A simple object would not. See type `AuthMethodOutput`
- extracts `buildResponse` into a testable function and adds test. For `Set-Cookie` headers we return an array of strings.

In the middleware here's the code I had for the final conversion:

```ts
if (AUTHHANDLER_REQUEST) {
  const output = await dbAuthHandler(req)

  const finalHeaders = new Headers()
  Object.entries(output.headers).forEach(([key, value]) => {
    if (Array.isArray(value)) {
      value.forEach((v) => finalHeaders.append(key, v))
    } else {
      finalHeaders.append(key, value)
    }
  })

  return new MiddlewareResponse(output.body, {
    headers: finalHeaders,
    status: output.statusCode,
  })
}
```
