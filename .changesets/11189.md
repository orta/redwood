- fix(babel-plugins): Handle additional syntax when extracting graphql options (#11189) by @Josh-Walker-GM

This fixes an issue with the automatic extraction of options from the `createGraphQLHandler` function when you were wrapping that function within a custom handler function. For example the following would have failed before this fix:

```ts
const graphQLHandler = createGraphQLHandler({
  // ...options
})
export const handler = (event, context) => {
  return graphQLHandler(event, context)
}
```
