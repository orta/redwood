- feat(exec): Add --silent to silence all RW output (#11278) by @Tobbe

Run with `--silent` (or `-s`) to not have the framework itself print anything to
your console. Only console logs you have yourself in the script, or any files
the script includes, will come through.

If you're using Prisma you might want to tweak Prisma's logging (in
`api/lib/db.ts`) and turn off "info" logging, depending on your goals.
