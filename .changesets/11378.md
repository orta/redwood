- feat(uploads): Add File scalar to rootSchema (#11378) by @dac09

Adds `File` scalar to rootSchema, to enable parsing fields set to File as a https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File

The parsing and scalar is actually built in to GraphQL Yoga, this change just enables it by default instead of having to add `scalar File` to one or more of your SDLs.
