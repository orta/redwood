- fix(cli): avoid `require` in prettier config during tailwind setup (#10183) by @Josh-Walker-GM

With the recent switch to prettier v3 we are no longer able to use `require` within the `prettier.config.js`
config file. This change prevents the tailwind setup CLI command from adding a require statement when it adds
the `'prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'` plugin and instead it simply inserts the plugin name as a string. This
fixes commands such as `yarn rw lint` which would have failed in the presence of such a `require` statement.
