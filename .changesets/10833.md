- fix(deps): update dependency firebase-admin to v12 (#10833) by @renovate

This change updates our firebase auth provider to use the v12 major version of the `firebase-admin` package. This will require you to update your own version of `firebase-admin` that is listed in your api side package json file.

We have noticed no breaking api changes in our limited testing. Please consult the `firebase-admin` upgrade guide if you experience problems after upgrading - especially if you have more extensive or complex use of the firebase suite of products.
